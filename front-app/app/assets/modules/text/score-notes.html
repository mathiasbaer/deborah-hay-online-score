								<p class="title">No Time to Fly (2012)</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>These are only the "notes" paragraphs from the original score text.</p>

							<div class="scene" data-title="fred + ginger"></div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="the beginning"></div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="curved path">
		
								<p>Note: Nothing about my performance ends at the end of the curl.</p>
		
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="link to portal">
								
		
								<p>Note: I attend to the exactness of the single broad curve so that when I face my entrance site it is as if I complete the stringing of an archer&rsquo;s bow.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: I deliberately create this space within a space, separating me from the audience.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: The ancient voice is me from 10,000 years ago bringing that possibility into the present.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: My choice to perform this material requires catastrophic acts of perception. I associate catastrophic with images of great loss. The magnitude and reoccurrence of choreographed behavior that I need to first recognize and then dis-attach from, again and again, is a personal loss of tremendous proportion. </p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="break cord and second beginning">
								
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="joy + sorrow">
								
								<p>Note: I am not limited to my personal experience of joy and sorrow. It is a relief to know that it is in and about the audience, this theater, and the world beyond its doors.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: As I perform, I try to remove my tendency to embody the images I use to describe the movement material.</p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="wordless song">
		
								<p>Note: I hear the song as my voice leaves my body. I am intentionally unguarded because I rarely allow myself to partake in unprotected experiences. </p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: I am not translating the written language into movement, i.e., joy and sorrow. I actually aspire toward a bodily speechlessness by noticing my visual field, which includes what I can and cannot see, as well as minute associative instances that rise spontaneously.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: I understand that joy and sorrow are always present. I do not have to instigate them. &nbsp;</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: Singing a song of joy and sorrow is a challengingly simple way for me to engage my perception of space and time. </p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: I strongly maintain the role of the choreographer, overseeing the particularity of the path I travel and making spatial choices without becoming too artistic.</p>
								<p></p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="hidden diagonal">
								
								<p>Note: While dancing I make an effort not to hesitate. Learned behavior suggests I slow down or listen more in order to get things right. That is a belief that limits my dance.</p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="1 minute turn">
								
								<p>Note: My head is free to look down or away or to turn. It is not fixed.</p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="work">
								
								<p>Note: I accept any movement that arises spontaneously and call it work. </p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: During this movement it is helpful to enlarge my perception of space beyond the theater.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: There is no repetition in live performance.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: Work&nbsp;comes easily. Maybe it is because of what is required to survive as a dancer in contemporary western culture. It can be difficult to dis-attach from the habitual physical response to what &ldquo;work&rdquo; looks like, i.e., striving, reaching, pushing, dragging, busying, flailing, hauling.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: I neither hurry nor linger.</p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="complexity">
								
								<p>Note: The movement is not difficult just because I use the words complexity, havoc, abstruse, choreographically challenging. And clearing the dance of complexity&nbsp;does not necessarily require flowing movement.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: If I can manage my perception of time and space to inform my body, then I do not have to think about what movement to do next. What I mean by my perception of time is that it is passing. And what I mean by my perception of space is that I include it in my dancing so that I am not seduced by the intelligence, past experiences, patterns, limitations, and/or sensuality of my moving body. &nbsp;</p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="mall + object">
								
								<p>Note: I attend to my perception of space and time in order to distract myself from predetermining the outcome of this choreographic direction. It is an effort to refrain from creating a literal mall. Instead, copious instances of a mall&nbsp;appear and disappear as I dance. </p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: I do not create&nbsp;object. I learn its attributes from my body and actually take pleasure in identifying the object for myself in each performance.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: I remember to notice that my whole body is producing unimaginable instances of specificity.</p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="particle">
								
								<p>Note: The movement may change, but the choreography itself does not change.</p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="holy + indian">
								
								<p>Note: I am&nbsp;a holy site&nbsp;and to perform as such requires the catastrophic loss of how I otherwise perceive myself.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: I call what I hear a holy song and notice the feedback from my whole body as it yields to that direction.</p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="tiptoeing">
								
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="beckett quote">
								
								<p>Note: The quote&rsquo;s impact on my body is mind-boggling.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: My finger can be a trap. I do not fixate on it &ndash; deliberately hiding its function in determining my movement.</p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="silly song and dance">
								
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="market + traditional object">
								
								<p>Note: It is an effort to refrain from creating a marketplace. Instead, copious instances of predawn marketplace live and die spontaneously. It is all I need. </p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: I am not translating the written language into movement, i.e., utensil, crafted tool, marketplace. I actually aspire toward a bodily speechlessness so that I can notice and appreciate the abundance of materiality that can surface momentarily.</p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="counterintuitive travel">
								
								<p>Note: The term &ldquo;counterintuitive travel&rdquo; is what it is &ndash; another way. Counterintuitive reflects possibility, not intention, psychology, or effort.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Note: I do not become cranky. Cranky describes my voice.</p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="mend">
								
								<p>Note: Accepting any movement, I call it mend. At the same time it is an effort not to automatically produce comforting arm or hand movements or behave like a mother hen. </p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="road">
								
								<p>Note: I strongly maintain the role of the choreographer, overseeing the design element of the road. I think of the road&rsquo;s surface as a mosaic, without getting too artistic. </p>
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="holy site + song">
								
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="standing">
								
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="face audience">
								
							</div>
		
							<div class="scene" data-title="joy + sorrow again">
