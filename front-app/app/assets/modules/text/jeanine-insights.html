<div class="scene" data-title="before">
	I try to do my work of decision-making before the performance starts. I try to challenge my readiness, so my decision-making is more instantaneous. One thing that happens before going on into the space, onto the stage, is using the audience as another kind of material.
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="fred + ginger">
<p>	For Fred and Ginger what I'm trying to do is keep all of the balls in the air as much as possible, priming myself to the space, to my use of time right away, and also my relationship to the audience. The terminology Fred and Ginger is just this little trick to kind of keep you alert, more alert. There are a lot of those tricks in the score and the language.</p>

<p>It’s not just what you see concretely, but it's what you imagine you see. So you're also priming your perception on all these different levels. It's what you see but also what you don't see literally. It also disrupts continuity. In Deborah's work there are these little mechanisms or devices, and the image of Fred and Ginger is just one of them. </p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="the beginning">
	I really try to attend to seeing the curve in the space, on the floor or in the space itself, rather than just starting and then finding the curve as I'm doing it.
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="curved path">
<p>And then once you step, that first step of the unfamiliar rhythm, walking kind of like your own but not really, that's always a weird thing because you have accept the first thing that comes up. It is an interesting beginning to have, to have to accept what's there and then follow that through for the rest of the path.</p>

<p>I'm trying to attend as much as I can to the curved path, to not veering off of it, to experiencing it through the space, but not just on the floor but through the entire space. And also attending to this unfamiliar familiar way of walking, so that's also something in Deborah's work, that there are multiple things that you're focusing on. So it's not just one thing and as a result there's a kind of disruption of your use of time and your use of space. So you're being asked to hold onto a linear thought or a linear progression, but at the same time you're asked to disrupt that. And that's the kind of physical paradox that's going on all the time.</p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="link to portal">
Facing the portal is this moment of reminding yourself that it's not just about your experience, that it's about this other, larger realm that includes all of space, all of time …
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="break cord and second beginning">
Even though I'm not looking around at the whole space, I'm trying to attend to the multi-dimensionality of the space and my relationship to it. So as I break the cord to turn to face the audience, I'm trying to include all of the space around me before I face the audience. 
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="joy + sorrow">
	It's not binary but it's this sense of all of these things being included at every moment. So it's not from moment to moment, I'm sad this moment and then joyful this moment. It's that those two things are co-existing always. And one never achieves, never fully achieves one or the other. I also see Joy and Sorrow happening in the space, not just in my experience but it is happening all the time in who or what I see so the curtain may appear to be an image of either joyfulness or sorrow-ness. You really have to be empty there and not have a notion of how it's going to go. And the subtleness makes you have to work harder, in a way.
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="wordless song">
<p>I first of all try not to determine when I choose when for the song is the right time. I try to open my mouth and just go. Because when I've experienced it as ‘oh, this is the right time for the song now’, it usually never works well that way. So I try to let the body determine when I start singing. And then I try to keep hearing the song and what the song is telling me about joy and sorrow and how that's sort of resonating through the space. </p>

<p>Where I find it's mostly a break is going into the movement. That's a little bit of a tricky place for me, attaching rhythmic movement to the song. And I think I have an image of what that movement should be, and I always try to scramble that up. Especially in terms of time, because it can get really slow and sustained qualitatively and I think I really need to kick up joy more in that. So it has different layers going on. So it's not one rhythm. </p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="hidden diagonal">
<p>I always am aware of this diagonal but I'm trying to erase it at the same time. I don't want to give away that I'm travelling in this direction, so in this way I'm also constantly in negotiation with the audience and trying to maybe understand how they're perceiving this pathway and trying to trick them to not see it any more.</p>

<p>And this sense of being on the diagonal that's going to end on the edge of the space and where you're going to do that One Minute Turn. That's also the choreography unfolding. I used to practice it where I would just end up wherever I would end up, but then it really requires more than that. You really have to be choreographing the space because your whole relationship to challenging the audience to keep negotiating the space with you is part of the deal. </p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="1 minute turn">
You're trying to disrupt your natural tendency for being slow because you have one minute, and you're also considering this external relationship to time. You're trying to mark what one minute is. So there are a lot of different frictions, I guess. And also this notion of turning, is it turning in your body or is turning in the entire space, and then you have this consideration of your body as part of the space and all of that is going on there. And the intersection of the voice from the song of joy and sorrow is just another trick to kind of keep you alert and not fall, not drop in that moment, because it's easy just to drop there and not stay present.
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="work">
Work is kind of terrifying... because you have these really mundane actions that have to repeat themselves over and over again. And again it's a trick for you to constantly remind yourself that it's not about what you're doing. It's about how you're perceiving space and time. So she, Deborah, puts it in there to make you have to work on those other tools and not rely on what your body is doing. You really have to kick up your choreographic tools, that space and time thing, how you're choreographing those two elements. Work just reminds you that you have to use these other elements and it's not just about what your body is capable of doing, but how you're using these other perceptions. Work is intense, you know.
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="complexity">
	It's not about doing complex actions or doing complex movement. It's about how you are perceiving space and time in a complex way. And at the same time, complex is not what you would normally identify with complex. So you're constantly playing with those notions of freeing yourself from what you think complexity is and then going back into what you think complexity is. I notice in that section that what my body is doing is also informing, it's this back looping constantly happening, which I think is happening all the time, but particularly I'm noticing it more in that section. That what my body is materially doing also affects how I am perceiving complexity. It's a sort of feedback loop.
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="mall + object">
<p>In this sort of not even transition I will feel perceptually I'm still in Complexity, and then all of a sudden I realise, ‘oh, my body is activating the space in a different way’. My body is already in Mall. Sometimes I have to decide that it's happening, that I make the decision I'm going to start to activate Mall. But a lot of times in those performances, my body has started activating Mall before I'm conscious of it. Then it's just a matter of me noticing where I am. </p>

<p>I try not to search for the object but I try to notice that the object is there. And then I, in my playing out of the object, I try to... I don't necessarily name it, but I try to understand what that object is that doesn't have a name, that it's not identifiable, but I try to understand through what my body is doing what that object is. And it takes on its own kind of identification. </p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="particle">
	<p>I'm not so conscious of moving into Particle, it seems like it kind of just is within Mall. Then all of a sudden it's like this gust and I'm caught in it. Sometimes I'm activating Particle through the space of Mall, but sometimes I'm activating Particle through a feeling. It also depends on the time element and the choreographic element. Because I can stay in Mall for a really long time and I know that I have that tendency. So sometimes I really have to choreograph Particle into Mall, making it happen, and sometimes it's just there. </p>

<p>Really imagining that I am literally a fleck or a speck of dust. Sometimes I have the sense that I'm in the space that I'm in, like the theatre space, the entire space is moving. Sometimes I have that sensation and that perception of the space, and I'm just a speck in the midst of that. Sometimes, the space is sort of vortexing. And sometimes I have a kind of global sensation or perception, that I'm a part of this larger thing, but that I'm very small. And it kind of streams among those, I guess, sensation perception. </p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="holy + indian">
<p>Qualitatively I start to feel my body more dynamically, and I'm not only trying to perceive my body as a holy site, but also how I'm gathering the space around me and how I see everything as a holy site, and that I'm just one part of that. So it's not, that just my body is the holy site, but the space is and I'm a part of the space in that way. And also this thing of the tapping, it is another device or tool to keep me active so I don't fall into representing a holy site.</p> 

<p>I try to make this moment where the fingertips touch just happen, so I'm not making it happen. And accepting any awkward moment or place when my fingertips touch as holy. That's a kind of tricky moment there. Also just accepting, like with Work or the Curved Path, accepting as soon as it happens, whatever sound comes out is holy. I think there's so much residual information that I have, about what that sound is so it may go into the realm of being identified with holy, like a holy chant or song. But I try not to determine what that's going to sound like. </p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="tiptoeing">
<p>	I'm aware of the space that was built and destroyed, like all the sites in the space and I try to not disturb that. So, it's very light. At the same time the directive is that you're parting the space. It's very deliberate, like your body's affecting the space, but not disturbing the space at the same time, so it's kind of a physical paradox. And then also choosing where to be in relationship to the audience, but also where I haven't been before in the space. </p>

<p>Bouncing to the drums that only you can hear, but it doesn't have a rhythm, that's also one of these, you know, what I call impossible possibilities, like, you know, you're trying to activate it but it's not really happening so you're never really arriving, and it's a way of also keeping you alert and keeping your attention active. </p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="beckett quote">
<p>Part of the Beckett Quote is composing the time there for yourself and choosing when to do that quote is also a big thing because it's the first time there's a text that is in the language with a consequence, with a thought involved, and so there's a kind of weight to it. And, so that's a... playing that is a nice moment there, deciding when to do that.</p>

<p>I'm really aware of the kind of gravity of it and the time it takes for it to sink in, not only for myself but for the audience. There's always this inevitable, retrospective realisation from the audience that they heard the thing that they heard and then they're seeing the image of the body in this way, and it's sort of a delayed reaction.</p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="silly song and dance">
	I feel like the song starts to support the absurdity of that moment and so the song in that way is an extension of that nowhere place and it destabilises this moment of moving into the space. It's interesting, from the end of the Beckett Quote through the Snake Charmer Song, and into the beginning of Market, all feel like they're not differentiated somehow for me. They all slide into one another. Even though I'm aware of the sequence of it.
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="market + traditional object">
<p>	I feel like the second half of the work for me really changed a lot. I used to perform Market much more actively. And then Deborah gave me the directive of doing it mainly in stillness and even though it's actually written into the script that it's mostly... I don't know exactly how, but stillness is in the language.</p>

<p>I never really identify what the object is. I try not to name it, the same way that I don't in Mall. And I'm trying to figure out the object-ness of my body and how that might be an object in a 5,000 year old market. So, images, like in Mall, sort of pass through. But it's the quality of the image that I think is differentiated in my state of mind, it's much more open. And I imagine much more space and it's less condensed and dense, so usually there's much more spaciousness in the object and less activity. </p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="counterintuitive travel">
Counterintuitive Travel, with Cranky Voice, is one of the weirdest things that I've ever performed. It's really hard not to know what it is, and the less I know what it is... it's weird, it's like the Counterintuitive Travel brings you down physically to your feet and then the Cranky Voice really brings you up high into your head. So you're in this extreme sort of physical place. And then what's happening in between is really weird and unknown. And the fact that your voice is cranky but you're not, it's just so much to deal with that the body just gets really confused. And I think it's just a very interesting thing to perform. It's also one of those things choreographically that I have no idea how it functions in the choreography. The other things I can sort of make a kind of sense of in the scope of the whole thing, and this I can't. And I think maybe that's also why it's there, like it scratches something out of nowhere.
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="mend">
<p>For me I think it's a choreographic thing, from the American Indian chant into the Beckett Quote into the Charmer Song into Market, and even to some extent into Counterintuitive Travel. All those five elements stay within the same spatial configuration. It doesn't travel through the space. So I feel like Mend is one of those moments where I get to choreograph the space, like I get to start to move into the space.</p>

<p>I think it's just the nature of Mend that there's something qualitatively different that makes me want to go to the body first rather than go into the space. So even though I'm travelling through the space... it has on some level it has a similarity to Work in that there's a repetitive notion to it and that I'm also accepting that the first movement that I make as I move into the space is mending. And then what I'm doing is I'm constantly, everything that's happening is mending. So I have to almost convince myself that this is Mend. </p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="road">
<p>And what I'm trying to do is also attend to the entire space, which is tricky because when you start to work on your feet really particularly and you're listening to the music of your feet, it's easy to get only attentive to that. So I really try to attend to the whole space at the same time, so that I'm seeing the road being built in, not only underneath me but around the space. Underneath me it's more material, say, and out there it's more spatial and imagistic and by that I mean I really feel like I am gathering in material here, it is dirt or mud or it's cobblestone. I'm activating it that way. </p>

<p>But my attention in my visual field is that I'm imagining the road is more expansive than that. I am letting this happen in my perception and it doesn't necessarily have to happen physically. So that's how I get around the problem of having to cover the whole space.</p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="holy site + song">
<p>I'm turning the road rather than the road turning me. And there's something also about gathering the space, gathering the expanse of the space back into my body. So, I'm bringing the audience and the edges of the space and everything back in, and as I build the holy site, the turning is sort of functioning in that way for me, where I'm sort of zooming everything back in.</p> 

<p>There's something more like a vortex in this holy site, so it's also the position of the hands, now they're open and I try to imagine something kind of descending down through me, so the song is sort of coming down through the outside to the inside. I think also qualitatively, the quality of the voice or the nature of the voice is different for the two sections of holy song. There's more of a spilling out or something, or I guess a funnelling is more like it. </p>

<p>I'd say that it's collapsing with a kind of already history of everything that's come before. It feels different than the first Holy Site. There's more history to it or something. And also I'm aware that the audience has a relationship already to that position. </p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="standing">
	
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="face audience">
	
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="joy + sorrow again">
	And it's a really slow fade, so you're very aware of the sort of inevitability of closure. You’re also still in this place where you're choreographing the end rather than the end happening to you. I try not to play a feeling there. I really try, because it's hard not to, it's really hard not to go into, ‘oh, this just happened’, and get into the narration aspect of it. So I try to stay with the physical action of streaming and to keep it pure in that way in terms of what the directives are, so that it has a chance of existing in whatever plane is being experienced by the audience.
