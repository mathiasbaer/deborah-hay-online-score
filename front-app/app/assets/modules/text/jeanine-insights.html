							<div class="scene" data-title="off"></div>
							<div class="scene" data-title="off"></div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="before">
							I try to do my work of decision-making before the performance starts. I try to challenge my readiness, so my decision-making is more instantaneous. One thing that happens before going on into the space, onto the stage, is using the audience as another kind of material.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="fred + ginger">
							For <b>fred and ginger</b> what I'm trying to do is keep all of the balls in the air as much as possible, priming myself to the space, to my use of time right away, and also my relationship to the audience. The terminology fred and ginger is just this little trick to kind of keep you alert, more alert. There are a lot of those tricks in the score and the language.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="the beginning">
							I really try to attend to seeing the curve in the space, on the floor or in the space itself, rather than just starting and then finding the curve as I'm doing it.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="curved path">
							<p>And then once you step, that first step of the unfamiliar rhythm, walking kind of like your own but not really, that's always a weird thing because you have accept the first thing that comes up.</p>

							<p>I'm trying to attend as much as I can to the <b>curved path</b>, to not veering off of it, to experiencing it through the space, but not just on the floor but through the entire space. And also attending to this unfamiliar familiar way of walking, so that's also something in Deborah's work, that there are multiple things that you're focusing on. So there's a kind of disruption of your use of time and your use of space. You're being asked to hold onto a linear thought or a linear progression, but at the same time you're asked to disrupt that.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="link to portal">
							Facing the <b>portal</b> is this moment of reminding yourself that it's not just about your experience, that it's about this other, larger realm that includes all of space, all of time …
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="break cord and second beginning">
							Even though I'm not looking around at the whole space, I'm trying to attend to the multi-dimensionality of the space and my relationship to it. So as I <b>break the cord</b> to turn to face the audience, I'm trying to include all of the space around me before I face the audience.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="joy + sorrow">
							So it's not from moment to moment, I'm sad this moment and then joyful this moment. It's that those two things are co-existing always. And one never achieves, never fully achieves one or the other. I also see <b>joy and sorrow</b> happening in the space, not just in my experience but it is happening all the time in who or what I see so the curtain may appear to be an image of either joyfulness or sorrow-ness. You really have to be empty there and not have a notion of how it's going to go.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="wordless song">
							<p>I first of all try not to determine when I choose when for <b>the song</b> is the right time. I try to open my mouth and just go. Because when I've experienced it as ‘oh, this is the right time for the song now’, it usually never works well that way. So I try to let the body determine when I start singing.</p>

							<p>Where I find it's mostly a break is going into the movement. That's a little bit of a tricky place for me, attaching rhythmic movement to the song. And I think I have an image of what that movement should be, and I always try to scramble that up. </p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="hidden diagonal">
							I always am aware of this <b>diagonal</b> but I'm trying to erase it at the same time. I don't want to give away that I'm travelling in this direction, so in this way I'm also constantly in negotiation with the audience and trying to maybe understand how they're perceiving this pathway and trying to trick them to not see it any more.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="1 minute turn">
							<p>You're trying to disrupt your natural tendency for being slow because you have <b>one minute</b>, and you're also considering this external relationship to time. You're trying to mark what one minute is. So there are a lot of different frictions, I guess. And also this notion of turning, is it turning in your body or is turning in the entire space.</p>

							<p>The intersection of the voice from the song of joy and sorrow is just another trick to kind of keep you alert and not fall, not drop in that moment, because it's easy just to drop there and not stay present.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="work">
							<p><b>Work</b> is kind of terrifying... because you have these really mundane actions that have to repeat themselves over and over again. And again it's a trick for you to constantly remind yourself that it's not about what you're doing. It's about how you're perceiving space and time.</p>

							<p>You really have to kick up your choreographic tools, that space and time thing, how you're choreographing those two elements. Work just reminds you that you have to use these other elements and it's not just about what your body is capable of doing, but how you're using these other perceptions.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="complexity">
							It's not about doing complex actions or doing complex movement. It's about how you are perceiving space and time in a complex way. And at the same time, complex is not what you would normally identify with complex. So you're constantly playing with those notions of freeing yourself from what you think <b>complexity</b> is and then going back into what you think complexity is.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="mall + object">
							<p>In this sort of transition I will feel perceptually I'm still in complexity, and then all of a sudden I realise my body is already in <b>mall</b>. Sometimes I have to make the decision I'm going to start to activate mall. But a lot of times, my body has started activating mall before I'm conscious of it. Then it's just a matter of me noticing where I am. </p>

							<p>I try not to search for the <b>object</b> but I try to notice that the object is there. And then I don't necessarily name, but I try to understand through what my body is doing what that object is.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="particle">
							I'm not so conscious of moving into <b>particle</b>, it seems like it kind of just is within mall. Then all of a sudden it's this gust and I'm caught in it. It also depends on the time element and the choreographic element. I can stay in Mall for a really long time and I know that I have that tendency. So sometimes I really have to choreograph particle into mall, making it happen. And sometimes it's just there.
							 </div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="holy + indian">
							<p>Qualitatively I start to feel my body more dynamically, and I'm not only trying to perceive my body as a <b>holy site</b>, but also how I'm gathering the space around me and how I see everything as a holy site, and that I'm just one part of that.</p> 

							<p>I try to make this moment where the fingertips touch just happen, so I'm not making it happen. And accepting any awkward moment or place when my fingertips touch as holy. Also just accepting, like with work or the curved path, accepting whatever sound comes out is holy. </p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="tiptoeing">
							<p><b>Tiptoeing</b> is a… I'm aware of the space that was built and destroyed, like all the sites in the space and I try to not disturb that. At the same time the directive is that you're parting the space. It's very deliberate, like your body's affecting the space, but not disturbing the space at the same time, so it's kind of a physical paradox.</p>

							<p>Bouncing to the drums that only you can hear, but it doesn't have a rhythm, that's one of these what I call impossible possibilities. You're trying to activate it but it's not really happening so you're never really arriving, and it's also a way of keeping you alert and keeping your attention active. </p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="beckett quote">
							<p>Part of the <b>Beckett quote</b> is composing the time there for yourself and choosing when to do that quote is also a big thing because it's the first time there's a text in the language with a consequence, with a thought involved. Playing that is a nice moment.</p>

							<p>There's always this inevitable, retrospective realisation from the audience that they heard the thing that they heard and then they're seeing the image of the body in this way. It's sort of a delayed reaction.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="silly song and dance">
							<p>I feel like the <b>song</b> starts to support the absurdity of that moment and so the song in that way is an extension of that nowhere place and it destabilises this moment of moving into the space.</p>

							<p>It's interesting, from the end of the Beckett quote through the snake charmer song, and into the beginning of market, all feel like they're not differentiated somehow for me. They all slide into one another. Even though I'm aware of the sequence of it.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="market + traditional object">
							I never really identify what the <b>object</b> is. I try not to name it, the same way that I don't in Mall. And I'm trying to figure out the object-ness of my body and how that might be an object in a <b>5,000 year old market</b>. So, images, like in mall, sort of pass through. But it's the quality of the image that I think is differentiated in my state of mind, it's much more open.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="counterintuitive travel">
							<b>Counterintuitive travel</b>, with cranky voice, is one of the weirdest things I've ever performed. It's like the counterintuitive travel brings you down physically to your feet and then the cranky voice really brings you up high into your head. So you're in this extreme sort of physical place. And the fact that your voice is cranky but you're not, it's just so much to deal with that the body just gets really confused. And I think it's just a very interesting thing to perform. It's also one of those things choreographically that I have no idea how it functions in the choreography. I think maybe that's also why it's there.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="mend">
							I feel like <b>mend</b> is one of those moments where I get to choreograph the space, like I get to start to move into the space. On some level it has a similarity to Work in that there's a repetitive notion to it and that I'm also accepting that the first movement that I make as I move into the space is mending. And then everything that's happening is mending.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="road">
							<p>And what I'm trying to do is also attend to the entire space, which is tricky because when you start to work on your feet really particularly and you're listening to the music of your feet, it's easy to get only attentive to that. So I really try to attend to the whole space at the same time, so that I'm seeing the <b>road</b> being built in, not only underneath me but around the space.</p>

							<p>But with my attention in my visual field I'm imagining the road as more expansive than that. I am letting this happen in my perception and it doesn't necessarily have to happen physically.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="holy site + song">
							<p>I'm turning the road rather than the road turning me. And there's something about gathering the space, gathering the expanse of the space back into my body. I'm bringing the audience and the edges of the space and everything back in, and as I build the <b>holy site</b>, the turning is functioning in that way for me, where I'm zooming everything back in.</p> 

							<p>I'd say that it's collapsing with a kind of already history of everything that's come before. It feels different than the first Holy Site. There's more history to it or something. And I'm aware that the audience has a relationship already to that position. </p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="standing"></div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="face audience"></div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="joy + sorrow again">
								And it's a really slow fade, so you're very aware of the sort of inevitability of closure. You’re also still in this place where you're choreographing the end rather than the end happening to you. I try not to play a feeling there. I really try hard not to go into, ‘oh, this just happened’, and get into the narration aspect of it. So I try to stay with the physical action of streaming and to keep it pure in that way in terms of what the directives are, so that it has a chance of existing in whatever plane is being experienced by the audience.
