							<div class="scene" data-title="before"></div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="fred + ginger">
							It’s not orchestrated.  It’s not directed.  It’s a much more, I suppose, light experience, if your attention is on your relationship to space, and I think it’s that lightness in <b>fred and ginger</b> that really gives you the chance to notice everything else.  Not just to get hooked in on the movement or the idea, or your idea of what that should be.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="the beginning">
							When I’m standing at the edge of the space, I’m not necessarily picking the exact place I’m going to end up, but there’s definitely a spatial sweep that I’m absorbing while standing there, and once I’ve stepped on to that curve it finds itself as I go.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="curved path">
							<p>With the <b>curve</b> there’s a very clear choreographic direction, and I have the full intent of fulfilling that perfect curve.</p>

							<p>And you step on to the path, and you’re noticing it unfold as you go, but as you get closer to the other end your attempt to understand where the end of that curve is has flipped, because you are perceiving it from the other end of the curve. I suppose it’s just this spatial continuity that brings you back to that point in space where you can orient to where you began.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="link to portal">
							With that connection to the <b>portal</b>, the heartstring, I haven’t really tried to identify what the context for that pull or connection is. There’s something in the freedom of that not knowing what I’m connecting to, so I’m noticing miniscule bits of feedback, through my face, through my chest, through various parts of my body, and the shape of my body as I continue to work with that image.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="break cord and second beginning">
							Making that turn without carrying over any of that heartstring tension, because we have released it, is really hard. It’s very tempting to run with it, or to take it in with you, to take it with you to the next moment, which is not useful in the context of carrying on with the choreography and the dance.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="joy + sorrow">
							I just go straight to, probably the core of my body and place the <b>joy and sorrow</b> there, and immediately the face is connected to that. If I do it from the body it arrives to my face without me having to organise it. And I just trust that the attention I have on the audience, and the feedback I’m getting from that, or the attention I have behind me, really helps me ground joy and sorrow.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="wordless song">
							<p>I’m trying to let it come out of nowhere, just come out of the body, the whole body at once.  If I, for an instant, think about the <b>song</b> I’m in trouble. I just take it as it comes and follow the curve of the song. Follow the curve of the song until it forms itself.</p>

							<p>The first attempts I have at something like that are often superficial and feel fake, or feel like I'm trying to do something. And over time, that shifts into doing less and understanding how to do it through practising doing it. The practise of the dance day after day, is the key to eliminating the organisation, or thinking, or concreteness of how you think you want to do this thing.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="hidden diagonal">
							<p>Yes, with the <b>diagonal</b>, I tend to choose the direction... there's a moment at the beginning, where I step into the erasing of the diagonal and it's within those first few steps, that I choose the direction. In the end, any choice will, depending on how you play it and depending on your attention on where you direct it, the choice is really the choreographic tool that's at your disposal.</p>

							<p>So it wouldn't be like I'd choose an end point at the other end of the space, it's more of a direction that you accommodate as you go. But with intent, there is an intent there that supports the specificity and rigour of where you are in the space.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="1 minute turn">
							<p>I'm not counting. I'm not doing anything that gives me a clue as to how accurate I am to a <b>one minute turn</b>. It's just the poetics of one minute turn. You're changing your viewpoint over that time, several times. And so, the frame with which you will re-consider where you are, is constantly shifting. You're getting this very dynamic experience as you turn on the spot. When you turn to face the wall, for instance, that's a really huge shift of visual experience compared to if you're facing the stage, or the audience.</p>

							<p>But at the same time, it's very still and I often get to the end of it and that's the most difficult moment, because I suppose the time that you've been in it, feels like it could go on and on and on. How I finish that one minute turn in the early stages of practising this dance, really affected how I entered work. But over time, less and less.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="work">
							<p>It's the notion of <b>work</b> that is carried with you in whatever movement you set up. The... what it is to work. Not showing work. And over time, I allowed the timing between the two movements to be more simultaneous, or it wasn't. I didn't construct how those two movements played out against each other. And that became much more useful to me.</p>

							<p>If I put too much attention on the movement, I'm in trouble. So the work to just bring my attention more toward what is it to work, in the framework of this movement, is much more interesting. It actually gives me more room to move, to be anywhere, than paying attention to the shape of the movement or anything like that.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="complexity">
							I try not to understand what that instruction is. And in that, of course, there are enormous layers of <b>complexity</b>. As soon as it becomes something that you're playing out, it's not complexity after all. So the practice is just really keeping hold of your perception of where you are undone, or unresolved.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="mall + object">
							<p>While in complexity some position or some line, or some relationship to the space that I find myself in triggers my idea of <b>mall</b>. It's usually a certain engagement in my body and at a certain point, there's a shift I recognise. It could be physical, it can be imaginative, it can be the two things just firing off each other, just slightly give me the nod, that we can keep working in mall now.</p>

							<p>I never chose a specific object to make. I attempted that and it really wasn't working for me. So I would invent a new object every performance. Sometimes they were true objects, sometimes they weren't and I didn't get fixed on that at any one point.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="particle">
							The dust. It didn't need to be there very long and dynamically between what went before and what went after, it felt easy to have it in-between those two places, in-between mall and holy site. It was one of those moments in the dance I felt was framed really well. And I felt buoyed by the choreography in my attempt at that.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="holy + indian">
							If I relied on the structure of the choreography, taking some of each of those other sections of mall into dust, into the building of <b>holy site</b>, then ultimately by the time I would get to the top of holy site, it felt so potent, that it would just... it would be really hard to sustain. It was hard to come out clean with something from the body, a voice from the body, a sound from the body. I guess I recognised this as I was practising it in the earlier stages and therefore, had to work at starting again at each new place, starting again with dust and then starting again with the build.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="tiptoeing">
							<p>If I’ve already been in that one spot three times, I’m not going to return to it again in this moment because I have a very clear choice as to where I can place myself at the end of that <b>tiptoe</b> sequence. There’s a freedom to that moment spatially, in terms of carving out space and choosing where I’m going to place myself.</p>

							<p>The indian chant feels more subtle than the original attempt. And in that subtlety, it feels that the undoing of my idea of it is more available to me.</p>

							<p>At this point I’m more interested in choosing a place to end than I was with, say, curved line because we already… we’re three quarters of the way through the dance and I have a reading on how I’ve used the space already, so I’m more interested in certain spaces than others because I haven’t been there.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="beckett quote">
							The more the time passes after that <b>quote’s</b> been said, relishing the feedback from the space, audience, my body, the memory of that quote that’s just been said is still hovering in the air and you can hear it and you can feel it and you can experience the audience hearing it and feeling it. What unfolds within that time is always fabulously interesting to me.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="silly song and dance">
							If I choose to sing it, I’m singing it in relation to continuing to contemplate the impact of that quote and its presence or not, but if it is there, it informs the movement or dance or whatever comes after that. I think of the <b>song</b> and the movement as two separate things working simultaneously together, but somehow both independently support the resonance of that moment of the quote.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="market + traditional object">
							I really wait for, or I tend to wait for <b>market</b> to arrive. I mean, I notice the possibility for it, the way I do for mall. I love to reveal market because it’s in its language; it feels it could be anything but most of the time, I feel the revealing of it as quite subtle; quite a subtle dance and… but as I begin it, I feel like I can really let go of the consequence of that Beckett quote
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="counterintuitive travel">
							<b>Counterintuitive travel</b>, I used to work more with the image of the caravan and all the language that Deborah inserted in relation to that. And the physical language with the knees and the hips was a really great clue to get me going with this sequence and then that dropped away pretty quickly.
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="mend">
							<b>Mend</b> feels like we’re attending to the whole space in a generally, and then at the moment of switching to road, the attention is really on the specificity of carving out the road and mosaic and the detail of where the foot placement goes and simultaneously, kind of, back and forth between the detail of that… 
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="road">
							<p>Even though they’re interconnected somehow, separating your sequencing and rhythm from the previous moment, for me, feels more successful if that moment of stepping up onto the <b>road</b> into the spinning is clear, however you do that perceptually and physically all at once.</p>

							<p>The ability to really see the whole space and audience all at once as was the attempt in the beginning of Fred and Ginger, feels like top and tailing to me, and I guess pulling in everything I can from registering the dance as a whole at that point feels very rich as we come close to the end of the piece.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="holy site + song">
							<p>I’m very conscious of everything I’ve just been through in reaching this moment of the final <b>holy site</b>. And with that weight of experience behind you, there’s still the need, until the very end, to perform each section independently somehow. The constant work of maintaining the wealth of the journey behind, whilst dropping it so you can attend to the specificity and singularity of that particular moment.</p> 

							<p>So when the mouth opens I need to just start again with bringing in from above whatever is going to come in. I just have to remind myself every time to do that. And, again, I come back to the body. I go right down to my feet or wherever I need to go to ground myself and not fly away with the resonance of the piece that has just been.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="standing">
								
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="face audience">
								
							</div>

							<div class="scene" data-title="joy + sorrow again">
							And the <b>joy and sorrow</b> at the end, it really feels like you don’t have to do anything really, in that moment. The face seems to just have all that history or information there without performing anything beyond that.
