Design fixes
==========================
- flowplayer font
- grid behind cell (no empty cells needed then)
- cells: info, hover
- text cell: table?
- flowplayer: loading, align to top
- set overview page
	X title does not change back when in set view previous set is clicked again (go back)


Missing content
==========================
- final Amin animation & PM markers
- Jeanine & Amin interview
- dataptations --> Vimeo
- recording setup
- PieceMaker cell


Missing sets
==========================
- team, imprint
- help set


Design to do
==========================
- start page, logo position, background, info?
- help icon


General content
==========================
- make about / team / ... a set linked to from logo?
- help page
	X overlays do not jump to f+g (first marker on 00:00 ??)


General UX
==========================
- show keyboard shortcuts (-> help page?)
- keyboard shortcuts jump 1 column too far
- animate switch set -> selector -> set
- a global indicator that show where you are in the recordings / time / performer dimensions
- favicon / apple icon / ...
- check all title="" attribs .. language and accessibility
- missing: dim cells that are not "in range"


All tiles
==========================
- indicate which "is playing"
- slider: indicate where playing tile is in set?
- make sure playing content is visible
- handle space visible if cells are smaller than total window ... "offgrid", how does Google maps handle that?
- allow to pin information overlay
- cancel loading of images when scene is changed in between


Viz cells
==========================
- visualizations: crop content to (content + padding) so viz can adjust best to "cover" mode


Vimeo tiles
==========================
- auto-playing, focus the set window on them when they start


Flowplayer tiles
==========================
- buy to get rid of logo ($95, one domain): http://flowplayer.org/download/
- fetch current scene on deactivate for poster image
- show loading preview
- ?? HTML5 video not scaled right
- ?? sometimes the scene does not get loaded (if it is a late scene) ... or it does change twice, just after it loaded?
- full screen button missing
- store volume settings globally?
- ?? ignore own messages


Content
==========================
- optimize content for cell sizes
- compress static content
- missing.jpg needs replacement (per cell type? -> recording empty studio)


Mobile devices
==========================
- hide slider
- add hint about sliding
- tab to see info, tab again to play cell
- top bar is quite large with 72px height on mobile
- MoBa logo pixelated on Nx7


---------------------------------------- These are for later ... much later --------------------------------

General UX
==========================
- show left / right as transition


Content
====================================
- generative logo
