General content
==========================
- front page ... questions usage undecided, backgrounds
- final title? .. where does it go?
- make about / team / ... a set linked to from logo?
- generative logo


General code
==========================
- make global settings to be besed on one config file (streamer urls, server addresses, keys, ...), check module code as well!


General style
==========================
- logo / icons below slider
- set selection view needs many improvements
- allow for differently sized cells?


Mobile devices
==========================
- hide slider
- add hint about sliding
- tab to see info, tab again to play cell
- top bar is quite large with 72px height on mobile


General UX
==========================
- show left / right transition
- show keyboard shortcuts
- animate switch set -> selector -> sets


All tiles
==========================
- info hover
- indicate which "is playing"
- slider: indicate where playing tile is in set
- make sure content is visible
- handle space visible if cells are smaller than total window ... "offgrid", how does Google maps handle that?


Vimeo tiles
==========================
- auto-playing, focus set-window on them


Flowplayer tiles
==========================
- style interface
- buy to get rid of logo ($95, one domain): http://flowplayer.org/download/
- fetch current scene on deactivate
- show loading preview
- HTML5 video not scaled right
- sometimes the scene does not get loaded (if it is a late scene) ... or it does change twice, just after it loaded?
- full screen button missing

Content
==========================
- optimize content for cell sizes
- compress static content
