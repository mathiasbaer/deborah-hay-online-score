General
=================


Layout editor
==================

	x remove columns / rows
	  (empty right/bottom edges are removed, still needs update on page)
- list view: see which items are already in set
	x hover cell should highlight in list
	x filter is bad ux
	  (removed)
	x list-view items need better formatting and details (preview)
	x double click cell to edit it
- UNDO ?!
	x show save (ajax) is working in the back
	x grid should not be a <table> but use the same tech as the front end .. bunch of position
- select and remove multiple cells
[- switch the whole thing to use backbone.js ... jQuery.data() gets out of hand]


Sets
==================

- do they need an order?
- hidden / private sets?
	x edit aspect size
	x can not drag grid cell to "add-xy" and make more rows / cols
	x when moving grid cells around they loose their double click / hover feats.


Cells
==================

- preview / test cells
	x upload previews directly to S3
- test paths (in fields) on S3 / Vimeo / webserver
- allow for input field to become textarea to be able to enter longer texts
