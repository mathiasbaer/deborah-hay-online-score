General
=================

- hook into AWS to make finding paths / previews / videos easier


Layout editor
==================

x remove columns / rows
  (empty right/bottom edges are removed, still needs update on page)
- list view: see which items are already in set
x hover cell should highlight in list
x filter is bad ux
  (removed)
x list-view items need better formatting and details (preview)
x double click cell to edit it
- UNDO ?!
- show save (ajax) is working in the back
- grid should not be a <table> but use the same tech as the front end .. bunch of position


Sets
==================

x edit aspect size
- can not drag grid cell to "add-xy" and make more rows / cols
- when moving grid cells around they loose their double click / hover feats.


Cells
==================
- preview / test cells
