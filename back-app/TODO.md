Layout editor
=============
x remove columns / rows
  (empty right/bottom edges are removed, still needs update on page)
- list view: see which items are already in set
x hover cell should highlight in list
- filter is bad ux
- list-view items need better formatting and details (preview)
x double click cell to edit it
- UNDO ?!
- show save (ajax) is working in the back

Sets
====
x edit aspect size
